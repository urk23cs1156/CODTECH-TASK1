Functions for Mathematical Operations:
Addition (Add()), Subtraction (Sub()), Multiplication (Mult()), Division (Div()):
These functions read the values from entry1 and entry2, perform the respective mathematical operation, and display the result in entry3 (an Entry widget).
Each function deletes any existing content in entry3, performs the calculation, converts the result to a string, and inserts it into entry3.

Layout Management: Consider using grid or pack instead of place for more flexible layout management.

This program provides a basic structure for a calculator interface using Tkinter, but it currently lacks functionality for number input and result calculation when the "=" button is pressed. 
Enhancing these aspects will make the calculator more usable and interactive.
